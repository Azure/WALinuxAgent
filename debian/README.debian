The preferred method of installing WALinuxAgent for Ubuntu is to use Debian
Packaging. Ubuntu supports the official Ubuntu WALinuxAgent version, which
can be found here: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/walinuxagent . The
Debian packaging is derived from the source here.

These instructions tell you build the package with out having to install
too many extra packages, and keep your source directory clean.

Run once:
    1. Install required packages:
        sudo apt-get -y install ubuntu-dev-tools pbuilder
    2. Create the pbuilder environment:
        sudo pbuilder create --debootstrapopts --variant=buildd

To compile the package:
    From the top-most directory, (i.e. not debian), run:

    1. Build the source package:
        dpkg-buildpackage -S

    2. Build the package:
        sudo pbuilder build ../walinuxagent_1.3-0ubuntu1.dsc

    3. Fetch the built package, usually from /var/cache/pbuilder/results
