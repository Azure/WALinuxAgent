walinuxagent (1.2-0ubuntu1) raring; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (LP: #1077148)
  * Upstream features:
    - Added - load ata_piix.ko module loaded if needed for CDROM device support
    - Additional logging for DoDhcpWork()
    - Update sock.recv timeout from 30 to 10 seconds
    - Fix: Linux waagent deprovision, user is not deleted properly
    - Fix: Make LBProbeResponder construction more robust
    - Fix: Agent fails to provision user with public/private key pairs
    - Fix: DHCP broadcast response not received
    - Fix: Linux agent fails to delete root user password
    - Fix: Linux agent should report error messages to Fabric when
           passed an invalid hostname.
  * Dropped Ubuntu specific patches
    - Removed debian/patches/000_resolv-conf.patch as upstream now supports
      resolvconf properly.
    - Removed debian/patches/001-strip-init-d.patch as redundant now that
      upstream understands Ubuntu upstart. Upstream script does not
      handle the removal of the upstart job anyway.
  * Added debian/patches/000_use_package_upstart.patch to use packaged
    upstart job over in-script upstart.

    (LP: #1079897):
    - d/{control,walinuxagent-data-saver.preinst}: Added

      not lost on upgrade by diverting /usr/sbin/waagent during the upgrade
      process.
    - d/walinuxagent-data-saver.lintian-overrides: Override errors about use
      of dpkg-divert in this package.
    - d/control: Added Pre-Depends to walinuxagent on walinuxagent-data-saver.
    - d/prerm: Stop calling waagent --uninstall during reconfiguration
      and upgrade, specify files to remove manually for purge.
    - d/postinst: Remove divert of /usr/sbin/waagent prior to completion of
      package install.
  * d/preinst: If upgrading from package version with unmanaged waagent upstart
    configuration stop the agent and remove the upstart configuration.
  * d/upstart: Tidied description in upstart job.
