# The source code suppresses the following errors in python3.6+:

# assignment-from-none<E1128>: (hi-pri) Used when an assignment is done on a function call but the inferred function returns nothing but None.
# attribute-defined-outside-init<W0201>: (hi-pri) Used when an instance attribute is defined outside the __init__ method.
# bad-indentation<W0311>: (hi-pri) Used when an unexpected number of indentation's tabulations or spaces has been found.

# bare-except<W0702>: (hi-pri) Used when an except clause doesn't specify exceptions type to catch.
# cell-var-from-loop<W0640>: (hi-pri) A variable used in a closure is defined in a loop. This will result in all closures using the same value for the closed-over variable.
# chained-comparison<R1716>: This message is emitted when pylint encounters boolean operation like"a < b and b < c", suggesting instead to refactor it to "a < b < c"
# consider-merging-isinstance<R1701>: Used when multiple consecutive isinstance calls can be merged into one.
# consider-using-enumerate<C0200>: Emitted when code that iterates with range and len is encountered. 
# consider-using-in<R1714>: To check if a variable is equal to one of many values,combine the values into a tuple and check if the variable is contained "in" it instead of checking for equality against each of the values.
# cyclic-import<R0401>: (hi-pri) Used when a cyclic import between two or more modules is detected.

# duplicate-string-formatting-argument<W1308>: (hi-pri) Used when we detect that a string formatting is repeating an argument instead of using named string arguments
# expression-not-assigned<W0106>: (hi-pri) Used when an expression that is not a function call is assigned to nothing.

# function-redefined<E0102>: (hi-pri) Used when a function / class / method is redefined.
# global-statement<W0603>: Used when you use the "global" statement to update a global variable.
# implicit-str-concat<W1404>: (hi-pri) String literals are implicitly concatenated in a literal iterable definition : maybe a comma is missing ?
# import-error<E0401>: (hi-pri) Used when pylint has been unable to import a module.
# inconsistent-return-statements<R1710>: (hi-pri) if any return statement returns an expression, any return statements where no value is returned should explicitly state this as return None, and an explicit return statement should be present at the end of the function
# invalid-name<C0103>: (needs review) Used when the name doesn't conform to naming rules associated to its type (constant, variable, class...).
# keyword-arg-before-vararg<W1113>: (hi-pri) When defining a keyword argument before variable positional arguments, one can end up in having multiple values passed for the aforementioned parameter in case the method is called with keyword arguments.
# len-as-condition<C1801>: (hi-pri) Used when Pylint detects that len(sequence) is being used without explicit comparison inside a condition to determine if a sequence is empty.
# multiple-imports<C0410>: (hi-pri) Used when import statement importing multiple modules is detected.
# lost-exception<W0150>: (needs review) Used when a break or a return statement is found inside the finally clause of a try...finally block: the exceptions raised in the try clause will be silently swallowed instead of being re-raised.

# no-value-for-parameter<E1120>: (hi-pri) Used when a function call passes too few arguments.
# pointless-string-statement<W0105>: (hi-pri) Used when a string is used as a statement (which of course has no effect). This is a particular case of W0104 with its own message so you can easily disable it if you're using those strings as documentation, instead of comments.
# protected-access<W0212>: Used when a protected member (i.e. class member with a name beginning with an underscore) is access outside the class or a descendant of the class where it's defined.
# raising-format-tuple<W0715>: (hi-pri) Used when passing multiple arguments to an exception constructor, the first of them a string literal containing what appears to be placeholders intended for formatting

# too-few-public-methods<R0903>: Used when class has too few public methods, so be sure it's really worth it.
# too-many-ancestors<R0901>: (hi-pri) Used when class has too many parent classes, try to reduce this to get a simpler (and so easier to use) class.
# too-many-arguments<R0913>: Used when a function or method takes too many arguments.
# too-many-branches<R0912>: Used when a function or method has too many branches, making it hard to follow.

# ungrouped-imports<C0412>: (needs review) Used when imports are not grouped by packages
# unidiomatic-typecheck<C0123>: (hi-pri) The idiomatic way to perform an explicit typecheck in Python is to use isinstance(x, Y) rather than type(x) == Y, type(x) is Y.
# unnecessary-comprehension<R1721>: (hi-pri) Instead of using an identity comprehension, consider using the list, dict or set constructor.
# unnecessary-lambda<W0108>: Used when the body of a lambda expression is a function call on the same argument list as the lambda itself
# unnecessary-pass<W0107>: (hi-pri) Used when a "pass" statement that can be avoided is encountered.
# unnecessary-semicolon<W0301>: Used when a statement is ended by a semi-colon (";"), which isn't necessary

# useless-import-alias<C0414>: (hi-pri) Used when an import alias is same as original package.e.g using import numpy as numpy instead of import numpy as np
# useless-return<R1711>: (hi-pri) Emitted when a single "return" or "return None" statement is found at the end of function or method definition.
# useless-super-delegation<W0235>: Used whenever we can detect that an overridden method is useless, relying on super() delegation to do the same thing as another method from the MRO.
# wrong-import-order<C0411>: (hi-pri) Used when PEP8 import order is not respected (standard imports first, then third-party libraries, then local imports)
# wrong-import-position<C0413>: (hi-pri) Used when code and imports are mixed

[MESSAGES CONTROL]

disable=bad-whitespace, # Used when a wrong number of spaces is used around an operator, bracket or block opener. **REMOVED IN pylint-2.6.0**
    broad-except, # Used when an except catches a too general exception, possibly burying unrelated errors.
    consider-iterating-dictionary, # Emitted when the keys of a dictionary are iterated through the .keys() method.
    consider-using-dict-comprehension, # Although there is nothing syntactically wrong with this code, it is hard to read and can be simplified to a dict comprehension. 
    consider-using-set-comprehension, # Although there is nothing syntactically wrong with this code, it is hard to read and can be simplified to a set comprehension. 
    empty-docstring, # Used when a module, function, class or method has an empty docstring
    import-outside-toplevel, # Used when an import statement is used anywhere other than the module toplevel.
    line-too-long, # Used when a line is longer than a given number of characters.
    misplaced-comparison-constant, # Used when the constant is placed on the left side of a comparison.

    raise-missing-from, # Python 3's exception chaining means it shows the traceback of the current exception, but also the original exception. Not using raise from makes the traceback inaccurate, because the message implies there is a bug in the exception-handling code itself, which is a separate situation than wrapping an exception.
    superfluous-parens, # Used when a single item in parentheses follows an if, for, or other keyword.
    super-with-arguments, # Emitted when calling the super() builtin with the current class and instance. On Python 3 these arguments are the default and they can be omitted.
    too-many-statements, # Used when a function or method has too many statements. You should then split it in smaller functions / methods.
    trailing-newlines, # Used when there are trailing blank lines in a file.
    trailing-whitespace, # Used when there is whitespace between the end of a line and the newline.
    useless-object-inheritance, # Used when a class inherit from object, which under python3 is implicit
    duplicate-code # Indicates that a set of similar lines has been detected among multiple file. TODO: this is on our "fix" list, and is thus left last.

# This section controls the duplicate-code error.
