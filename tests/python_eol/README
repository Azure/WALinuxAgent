This directory contains a DevOps Azure Pipeline to execute the unit tests for Python 2.6 and 3.4.

Currently those tests are executed using Github Actions, using .github/workflows/ci_pr.yml. The
setup done by ci_pr.yml is practically identical to the setup done by this Dockerfile, with minor
 differences to account for the differences between Github Actions and Azure Pipelines.

 NOTE: ci_pr.yml also depends on the patch_python_env.sh script.
