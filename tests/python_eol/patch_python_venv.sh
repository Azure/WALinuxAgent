# The pre-built Python virtual environments have hard dependencies on some of the shared libraries in Open SSL 1.0/1.1 (e.g libssl.so.1.0.0), which are not available on current Ubuntu versions.
# Modules like hashlib and ssl will fail to import. The Agent uses classes HTTPSConnection and HTTPS, which depend on the ssl module. Those classes are added conditionally on the
# import of ssl on httplib.py and http/client.py with code similar to:
#
#     try:
#        import ssl
#    except ImportError:
#        pass
#    else:
#        class HTTPSConnection(HTTPConnection):...
#        class HTTPS(HTTP):...
#        def FakeSocket (sock, sslobj):...
#
# Since the import fails, the classes will be undefined. To work around that, we define dummy items that raise NotImplementedError. The unit tests mock those classes anyway, so the
# actual implementation does not really matter.
