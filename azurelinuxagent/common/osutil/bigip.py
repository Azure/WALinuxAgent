        Azure(Stack) uses the name that you provide in the Web UI or ARM (for

        problem is that there is nowhere in the UI that specifies the
        restrictions and checks that tmsh has for the hostname.

        For example, if you set the name "bigip1" in the Web UI, Azure(Stack)
        considers that a perfectly valid name. When WAAgent gets around to
        running though, tmsh will reject that value because it is not a fully
        qualified domain name. The proper value should have been bigip.xxx.yyy

        WAAgent will not fail if this command fails, but the hostname will not
        be what the user set either. Currently we do not set the hostname when
