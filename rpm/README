The preferred method of installing the Windows Azure Linux Agent for
CentOS and other RPM-based distributions is to use the RPM packaging.
Platform images in the Azure Gallery will already include the agent
package. This guide is primarily for individuals who would like to
build their own custom packages.

OpenLogic provides supported RPM packages for CentOS in their package
repositories, for example
http://olcentgbl.trafficmanager.net/openlogic/6/openlogic/x86_64/RPMS/

Note: Official packaging and other patches for SLES and OpenSUSE can be
found on the OpenSUSE Build Service:  
https://build.opensuse.org/package/show?package=WALinuxAgent&project=Cloud%3ATools

The instructions below will describe how you can build your own RPM
package on a CentOS host:

    1. Install required rpmbuild package:

         yum -y install rpm-build

    2. Set up the rpmbuild environment:

         mkdir -p ~/rpmbuild/{SPECS,SOURCES}

    3. Download the WALinuxAgent source code as a tar.gz compressed
       file from Github, or create it yourself:

         tar -czf WALinuxAgent-1.x.x.tar.gz WALinuxAgent-1.x.x

    4. Copy the files to the rpmbuild environment:

         cp walinuxagent.spec ~/rpmbuild/SPECS
         cp WALinuxAgent-1.x.x.tar.gz ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES

    5. If necessary, edit the ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/walinuxagent.spec file
       and ensure that the 'Version', 'Source0' and other information
       is accurate.

    6. The following command will build the binary and source RPMs:

         rpmbuild -ba ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/walinuxagent.spec


Enjoy!
