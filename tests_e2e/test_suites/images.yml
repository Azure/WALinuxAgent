# An image can be specified by a string giving its urn, as in
#
#    ubuntu_2004: "Canonical 0001-com-ubuntu-server-focal 20_04-lts"
#
# or by an object with 3 properties: urn, locations and vm_sizes, as in
#
#   mariner_2_arm64:
#      urn: "microsoftcblmariner cbl-mariner cbl-mariner-2-arm64 latest"
#      locations:
#         - "eastus"
#      vm_sizes:
#         - "Standard_D2pls_v5"
#
# 'urn' is required, while 'locations' and 'vm_sizes' are optional. The latter
# two properties can be used to specify that the image is available only in
# some locations, or that it can be used only on some VM sizes.
