# An image can be specified by a string giving its urn, as in
#
#    ubuntu_2004: "Canonical 0001-com-ubuntu-server-focal 20_04-lts latest"
#
# or by an object with 3 properties: urn, locations and vm_sizes, as in
#
#   mariner_2_arm64:
#      urn: "microsoftcblmariner cbl-mariner cbl-mariner-2-arm64 latest"

#         - "eastus"
#      vm_sizes:

#
# 'urn' is required, while 'locations' and 'vm_sizes' are optional. The latter
# two properties can be used to specify that the image is available only in
# some locations, or that it can be used only on some VM sizes.
#
# URNs follow the format '<Publisher> <Offer> <Sku> <Version>' or
# '<Publisher>:<Offer>:<Sku>:<Version>'
