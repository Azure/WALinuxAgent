# An image can be specified by a string giving its urn, as in
#
#    ubuntu_2004: "Canonical 0001-com-ubuntu-server-focal 20_04-lts latest"
#
# or by an object with 3 properties: urn, locations and vm_sizes, as in
#
#   mariner_2_arm64:
#      urn: "microsoftcblmariner cbl-mariner cbl-mariner-2-arm64 latest"
#      locations:
#         - AzureCloud: ["eastus"]
#      vm_sizes:
#         - "Standard_D2pls_v5"
#
# 'urn' is required, while 'locations' and 'vm_sizes' are optional. The latter
# two properties can be used to specify that the image is available only in
# some locations, or that it can be used only on some VM sizes.
#
# The 'locations' property consists of 3 items, one for each cloud (AzureCloud,
# AzureUSGovernment and AzureChinaCloud). For each of these items:
#
#    - If the item is not present, the image is available in all locations for that cloud.
#    - If the value is a list of locations, the image is available only in those locations
#    - If the value is an empty list, the image is not available in that cloud.
#
# URNs follow the format '<Publisher> <Offer> <Sku> <Version>' or
# '<Publisher>:<Offer>:<Sku>:<Version>'
#
# NOTE ON VM SIZE FOR ARM64 VMs:
#      The VM size chosen by LISA for ARM64 VMs has recently produced VM that do not start, so we explicitly use
#      Standard_B2pls_v2 (which was the size LISA was using previously). Consider removing this explicit size
#      if/when the issue with the size selected by LISA is fixed.
