# FIPS should not affect extension processing. The test enables FIPS and then executes an extension.
#
# NOTE: Enabling FIPS is very specific to the distro. This test is only executed on Mariner 2.
#
# TODO: Add other distros.
#
# NOTE: FIPS can be enabled on RHEL9 using these instructions: see https://access.redhat.com/solutions/137833#rhel9),
#       but extensions with protected settings do not work end-to-end, since the Agent can't decrypt the tenant
#       certificate.
