# FIPS should not affect extension processing. This test enables FIPS and then executes an extension, the intention being to verify that all the
# cryptographic algorithms used by the Extensions pipeline (e.g. encryption of protected settings, creation of PFX packages, and communication
# Agent<->Wireserver) are FIPS approved.
#
# This test suite focuses on FIPS 140-3 and uses Ubuntu 22 and RHEL 9 as the representative distros for this feature. Note that Azure Linux 3
# is also FIPS 140-3 compliant, but, similarly to Windows, it takes a more permissive approach and deprecated cryptographic algorithms can still
# be used. We do not include Azure Linux 3 in the images here, it is already included in the "endorsed" image set and runs as part of the other
# test suites.
