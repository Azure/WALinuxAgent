#
# This test verifies that the Agent waits for cloud-init to complete before it starts processing extensions.
#
# NOTE: This test is not fully automated. It requires a custom image where the test Agent has been installed and Extensions.WaitForCloudInit is enabled in waagent.conf.
#       To execute it manually, create a custom image and use the 'image' runbook parameter, for example: "-v: image:gallery/wait-cloud-init/1.0.1".
