#
# This test verifies that the Agent does initial update on very first goal state before it starts processing extensions for new vms that are enrolled into RSM.
#
# NOTE: This test_suite is not fully automated. It requires a custom image where custom pre-installed Agent has been installed with version 2.8.9.9. Creation of custom images is not automated currently.
# But daily run is automated and test suite will pass shared gallery custom image reference in images list
