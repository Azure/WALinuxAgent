# This test verifies that the agent firewall rules are set correctly. The expected firewall rules are:
#        0        0 ACCEPT     tcp  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            168.63.129.16        tcp dpt:53
#       0        0 ACCEPT     tcp  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            168.63.129.16        owner UID match 0
#       0        0 DROP       tcp  --  *      *       0.0.0.0/0            168.63.129.16        ctstate INVALID,NEW
# The first rule allows tcp traffic to port 53 for non root user. The second rule allows traffic to wireserver for root user.
# The third rule drops all other traffic to wireserver.
