#
# This test verifies that the Agent can download and extract KeyVault certificates that use different encryption
# algorithms (currently RSA and EC).
#
# The test needs exclusive use of the VM because support for EC certificates was added on version 2.10. Daemons
# older than that version will fail to parse the certificates, and go on an infinite loop when fetching the goal
# state.
