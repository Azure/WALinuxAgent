name: "ExtSignatureValidation"
tests:
  - "ext_signature_validation/ext_signature_validation.py"
# Extension signature is sent by CRP only for CVMs, so this test suite should run exclusively on CVMs.

# This test needs to run in a canary region until all extensions being tested are published with signature in all prod regions.
# Extension signatures are currently only available in the public cloud, so we skip this test on other clouds.
