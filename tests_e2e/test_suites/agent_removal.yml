#
# This test can be used after agent deletion from PIR to validate that the expected versions were removed from the
# manifest in each region.
# There have been several instances of unexpected behavior after PIR removal, so this test should be executed to confirm
# the expected versions were successfully removed.
#
# Exactly one of the following arguments is required for the test:
#   a. expected_versions -
#         A semicolon separated list of the versions expected to be in the agent manifest.
#         If this argument is provided, the test will verify that the versions in the agent manifest match this list.
#         Example: expected_versions=2.9.1.1;2.10.0.8
#   b. removed_version -
#         The version of the agent which was removed and should not be in the agent manifest.
#         If this argument is provided, the test will verify that the agent manifest does not contian this version.
#         Example: removed_version=2.9.1.1
#
# The test also takes the following optional argument:
#   a. GAFamily -
#         The GAFamily (either Prod or Test) which determines what manifest will be validated.
#         Example: GAFamily=Test
#
# This test runs on one amd64 image and one arm64 image, since the manifests for amd64 and arm64 are different.
# Using ubuntu 24 since it does not have location restrictions.
