#
# This suite is used to test the scenario where outbound connections are blocked on the VM. In this case,
# the agent should fallback to the HostGAPlugin to request any downloads.
#
# The suite uses a custom ARM template to create a VM with a Network Security Group that blocks all outbound
# connections. The first test in the suite verifies that the setup of the NSG was successful, then the rest
# of the tests exercise different extension operations. The last test in the suite checks the agent log
# to verify it did fallback to the HostGAPlugin to execute the extensions.
