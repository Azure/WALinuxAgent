        Loads the description of a TestSuite from its YAML file.

        A test suite has 5 properties: name, tests, images, location, and owns_vm. For example:

              - "bvts/extension_operations.py"

            owns_vm: true

        * name     - A string used to identify the test suite
        * tests    - A list of the tests in the suite. Each test can be specified by a string (the path for its source code relative to
                     WALinuxAgent/tests_e2e/tests), or a dictionary with two items:
                        * source: the path for its source code relative to WALinuxAgent/tests_e2e/tests
                        * blocks_suite: [Optional; boolean] If True, a failure on the test will stop execution of the test suite (i.e. the
                          rest of the tests in the suite will not be executed). By default, a failure on a test does not stop execution of
                          the test suite.
        * images   - A string, or a list of strings, specifying the images on which the test suite must be executed. Each value
                     can be the name of a single image (e.g."ubuntu_2004"), or the name of an image set (e.g. "endorsed"). The
                     names for images and image sets are defined in WALinuxAgent/tests_e2e/tests_suites/images.yml.
        * location - [Optional; string] If given, the test suite must be executed on that location. If not specified,
                     or set to an empty string, the test suite will be executed in the default location. This is useful
                     for test suites that exercise a feature that is enabled only in certain regions.
        * owns_vm - [Optional; boolean] By default all suites in a test run are executed on the same test VMs; if this
                    value is set to True, new test VMs will be created and will be used exclusively for this test suite.
                    This is useful for suites that modify the test VMs in such a way that the setup may cause problems

                    force the agent to use the HGAP).
